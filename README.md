# Capstone Project: Analyzing current and future technology trends
The goal of the project was to analyze the current popular programming and web development languages. Based on the data collected from <ADD DATA SOURCE>, analyze and report the trends for the most popular languages.

## Project Outline

### 1. Data Collection using API
The objective was to collect the jobs data from Naukri.com using REST API via [www.kaagle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/promptcloud/jobs-on-naukricom). The results of the step can be reviewed under [1_Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API-Questions.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/1_Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API-Questions.ipynb)

### 2. Web scraping
The step involved extracting information about the name of programming language and annual salary from an HTML page and converting the data to CSV file. The details can be found in [2_Web-Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/2_Web-Scraping.ipynb)

### 3. Exploring the dataset

### Visualizing the data using Python

### Creating Project Dashboard
