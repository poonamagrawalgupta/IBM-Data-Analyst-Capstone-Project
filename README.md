# Capstone Project: Analyzing current and future technology trends
The goal of the project was to analyze the current popular programming and web development languages. Based on the data collected from <ADD DATA SOURCE>, analyze and report the trends for the most popular languages.

## Project Outline

### 1. Data Collection using API
The objective was to collect the jobs data from Naukri.com using REST API via [www.kaagle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/promptcloud/jobs-on-naukricom). The results of the step can be reviewed under [1_Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API-Questions.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/1_Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API-Questions.ipynb)

### 2. Web scraping
The step involved extracting information about the name of programming language and annual salary from an HTML page and converting the data to CSV file. The details can be found in [2_Web-Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/2_Web-Scraping.ipynb)

### 3. Exploring the dataset
As part of the project to understand the data better, I have extracted just the top 5 rows of the dataset to explore how the columns and rows look like. This can be reviewed via [3_M1ExploreDataSet.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/3_M1ExploreDataSet.ipynb)

### 4. Data Wrangling
After collecting data the most important part before analyzing is to clean the data such as finding missing data and removing duplicates from the dataset. In addition, to normalize the data and created new column using if statement for next step. Details of this step can be found in [4_M2DataWrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/4_M2DataWrangling.ipynb)

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis
This step involves identifying data distrubution using histogram, finding outliers using boxplot, removing outliers and find correlation between the features of dataset. This work was accomplished using Matplotlib and Seaborn which can be reviewed in [5_M3ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/poonamagrawalgupta/IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project/blob/main/5_M3ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb)

### 6. Visualizing the data using Python

### 7. Project Report
